# Wasteland Survivors

Wasteland Survivors is a top-down survivors shooter set in a post-apocalyptic environment. The game focuses on strategic survival, system awareness, and decision-making under pressure rather than fast reflexes alone.

This project is being developed as a hands-on study in Game Development, with emphasis on gameplay systems, clean architecture, and scalability.

## Goals

- Strengthen core Game Development fundamentals
- Build a portfolio based on real projects
